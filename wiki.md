# French Defence

The French Defense is my favorite opening as black against *1.e4*. It will usually lead to a complicated middlegame in which both sides have an equal chance.
<br>**advantage: solid structure** 
<br>**disadvantage: limited space** 

## Winawer Variation
![](https://www.chess.com/share/opening/default/French-Defense-Winawer-Variation)
The following book move is *4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bc3 6.bc Ne7*.
<br>The white will get doubled pawns as a weak point in exchange for the black having difficulty defending the kingside (due to the absence of dark-squared bishop).

### 7.Qg4
I like *7....Ng6* here rather than the normal book move *7....Qc7* (since I don't want to trade my black pawn at g7 with the white pawn at c3).
### 7.a4
I prefer *7....Qa5*, followed by *c4, Bd7, Nd7-b6* to attack the white pawn at a4 **(long castling is almost forced)**

## Advance Variation

The following book move is *5.Nf3 Qb6 6.a3*
<br>Here I like to play *6....a5* to prevent white from playing *7.b4*, followed by *f6, Ne7-f5* to attack the white center


## Exchange Variation
![](https://www.chess.com/share/opening/default/French-Defense-Exchange-Variation)
The following book move is *3....ed 4.Bd3 Bd6 5.Nf3 Nf6*
**Usually white is not willing to play this variation since it will lead to a fast and easy draw.**
